= Pac-Man with Elastic Stack

:toc:

:imagesdir: images/

Many people know how awesome the https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack[Elastic Stack] is and how powerful each technology from the stack can be.
However, most users struggle to find an end-to-end example based on time series data that makes usage of important features of the stack in a simple to understand scenario.
If that's you then you are in the right place. Meet *Pac-Man with Elastic Stack*.

This project contains an implementation of the game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man[Pac-Man] written in JavaScript.
This game can be automatically installed in a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) so that many users can play the game simultaneously.
As they play, events from the game will be created and stored in Elasticsearch.

         <td width="500">With all this data stored in Elasticsearch the game continuously reads the indices and computes in near real-time a scoreboard. The scoreboard lists all the available players and sorts them firstly based on their score, then based on their level, and lastly based on the number of their losses. The scoreboard is built based on features like <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html">searches</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html">aggregations</a>, and advanced features such as <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/transform-apis.html#transform-apis">transforms</a> and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-streams.html">data streams</a> can also be optionally enabled.</td>

In order to deploy the game you first need to create a deployment on https://www.elastic.co/cloud[Elastic Cloud]. Elastic Cloud is required here for three reasons.
Firstly because it is where the data will be stored.
An Elastic Cloud deployment contains a functional Elasticsearch cluster which is used as the data store for the events.
Secondly because it allows you to focus on the application code without wasting time with infrastructure plumbing.
Elastic Cloud is a managed service that handles the dirty details of having an Elastic Stack infrastructure that is highly available.
Finally, both the game and its data need to be co-located for performance reasons.
Since the game is deployed in a cloud provider, it makes sense to have the generated data stored in the same cloud provider and in the same region that the game is deployed.

## 1. Create a Deployment in Elastic Cloud

The game uses Elasticsearch as its data store so you need to have a cluster for this.
For the sake of simplicity and awesomeness you should use Elastic Cloud.
If you don't have an account with Elastic Cloud don't worry â€” creating one is easy and it takes only a few minutes. Click https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?elektra=en-cloud-page[here] to register a new account that is going to be trial and you won't pay a dime to Elastic before the trial ends.

Once you have an account, log in to Elastic Cloud and create a new deployment:

1. Click on the `Create deployment` button from the home UI.
2. Select `Elastic Stack` as the pre-configured solution.
3. Select `Memory Optimized` as the hardware profile.
4. Under `Deployment settings` click on the `Expand` button.
5. Select the `Cloud provider` and `Region` where you want to store the data.
+
*Note*: Keep in mind that whatever you select here will also dictate where the game will be installed.
6. In the bottom of the page click on the `Customize` button.
7. Under the data node section, click on `User settings override`.
8. Append the following content in the `User settings override` box.
   include::cors.settings[]
9. Click on the button `Create deployment` on the bottom of the page.
10. Take note of the `elastic` deployment credentials. You'll need it later.

## 2. Deploying the Game in the Cloud Provider
